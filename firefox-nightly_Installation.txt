First, download the latest version of Firefox nightly using the following command:

wget -o firefox.tar.bz2 'https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-nightly-latest-ssl&os=linux64&lang=en-US'

Next, extract the file using the tar command:

tar xvf firefox.tar.bz2

After the file is finished extracting, run the following command to move the files to the proper directory:

sudo mv firefox /opt

and enter your password and then press ENTER when prompted.

Now, run the following command to link your files:

sudo ln -s /opt/firefox/firefox /usr/local/bin/firefox-nightly

Firefox is currently installed. You can run firefox by executing the following command in a terminal:

firefox-nightly &

PART TWO

The following method will create a "desktop file" so that Firefox will show up in your list of installed applications and you won't have to run firefox from the terminal.

First, run the following command to create and edit the file using the nano text editor:

nano ~/.local/share/applications/firefox-nightly.desktop

Next, copy and paste the following contents into the terminal:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Firefox Nightly
Comment=Web Browser
Exec=/opt/firefox/firefox %u
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=/opt/firefox/browser/chrome/icons/default/default128.png
Categories=Network;WebBrowser;

Now, press CTRL+o to save the file and press CTRL+x to exit nano.

Finally, log out and log back in to refresh your list of installed applications.

PART THREE (only needed if you have disabled automatic updates)

To update Firefox nightly, click on the "hamburger" menu icon.

On the dropdown menu, click Help > About Nightly and it should show an option if Firefox is not up to date.
